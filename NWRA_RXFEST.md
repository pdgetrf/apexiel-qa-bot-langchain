The 9th annual Rallycross Fest is upon us! Nestled in the trees and mountains of beautiful Snoqualmie, WA , DirtFish
Rally School provides the best background for our favorite week of the year. This event is a true embodiment of why we
set out to start NWRA - making RX available to all levels of driver, partnering with the best instructors to help
drivers build their skills and bringing the community together for an incredible celebration of the sport we all love.

Rallycross Fest kicks off on Friday, July 26th with two workshops running simultaneously (Novice & Advanced). Saturday
and Sunday will be full days of racing on two separate courses. Competitors will race in one course on Saturday, July
27th followed by a second full day of racing on Sunday, July 28th.

Note: This format is different from previous years. The Novice and Advanced Workshops will be on the same day, running
simultaneously. This means that drivers will only be able to participate in a single workshop.

### General Info and Tips

#### Pre-Race

Don’t be afraid to ask questions: Facebook, email us or at an event. We are all here to help each other out!

Don’t stress about performance modifications – just show up. Talking about what you want to do to your car won’t get you
anywhere. Go race!

Shake down your car before a race. Just drive it around and make sure she is ready.

Pack well: bring a lunch, water, a towel, garbage bag and a change of clothes.

#### At the Race

Ask people about their cars and experience.

Partner up with an experienced driver – course walks, ride alongs, etc.

If you want to go fast, talk to people who are fast, watch what they do and learn from them as best as you can.

Be ok with hitting some cones – losing control can be a great way to learn about your car.

#### Is RallyCross safe?

Speeds are kept under control, thanks to great safety stewards and reasonable rules. We don’t run near hard objects and
make sure the course is maintained throughout the day.

#### What kind of car do I need?

Almost anything! It has to be production based and pass safety inspection. There are classes from stock (where you can’t
change anything on the car) to highly modified and everything in between. Many people RallyCross their daily driver.

#### What kind of tires are best?

It depends on your class!

Stock Class: Generally, an aggressive snow tire works best.

Prepared/Modified Class: We recommend some form of a reinforced rally tire. The tire compound and width depend on the
surface.

No matter the class, our suggestion is to see what experienced drivers in your region use – they know the surface and
have likely tried different options already.

#### What safety equipment is required?

Your car must be in sound operating condition and have:

working seat belts

doors that operate

functional brakes

secured battery

You must also have helmet with a SA/M 2005 rating or newer.

Rollcage is not required.

#### How do I figure out what class I should be in?

Class breakdown is totally dependent on the modifications made to your car. For example, if your car is completely
stock, you will compete in stock class. If you have a cold air intake and turbo back, you will be in prepared class. If
you have an engine swap, you’re in modified class. For a full list of the class breakdowns, check out the RallyCross
rule set.

#### What happens on race day?

When you arrive, you will be asked to sign a waiver. Once that is done, you will find a place to paddock and set up your
space. Prep your car (remove loose objects, change your tires and any other preparations needed) before going through
tech inspection and heading to registration.

Take some time to walk the course and get comfortable with it. This is a good time to make friends and get their take on
the best approach.

A driver meeting will be held about 30 minutes before race start where you will be given a run order and work
assignments. When you are not running, you are expected to perform your work assignment. This may be working a corner,
helping with start, finish or timing.

Once the driver meeting is complete, it is time to race!

### Definition of Rallycross

A rallycross is a motorsports event where vehicles race on a course delineated by cones on generally unpaved, mostly
flat surfaces. Elapsed time is tracked by the organizer with time-based penalties assessed for actions such as missed
cones and driving off-course. Scoring is the accumulation of timed runs plus penalties where the lowest time wins. One
car is released at a time with course workers monitoring cones and penalties.

Rallycross events are structured as a run-work format where competitors race during their class session and work the
course when another class races.

### Conduct of Competitors

Each competitor must:

- Practice good sportsmanship at all times.
- Register for and compete in the appropriate class for their vehicle. It is the driver’s responsibility to know the
  correct class based on the rules and vehicle classifications set forth in the Rallycross Rules.

- Obey all laws and local ordinances, most importantly, as they pertain to traffic laws.
- Not dispose of trash anywhere on site except for designated garbage receptacles.
- Follow the prescribed course. It is the competitor’s responsibility to know the course in order to keep other
  competitors, course workers and spectators safe. Competitors will be given the opportunity to walk and drive the
  course prior to competition.
- Fully perform their work assignment as instructed.

Failure to comply with the conduct requirements may result in disqualification and/or suspension.

### Competitor Eligibility

To be eligible for Rallycross competition, a driver must:

- Not be disqualified from event or suspended from competition.
- Be, at a minimum, 15 years old and meet one of the following criteria:
- a. Possess a valid (not expired or suspended) driver's license in their state of residence, or
- b. Possess a valid instruction permit and be accompanied by a parent/guardian that has been a licensed driver for at
  least five years.

### Passenger Eligibility

One passenger is permitted in a car during competition runs unless otherwise stated in event-specific communication. In
order for passengers to ride along, the following criteria must be met:

- A passenger seat must be present and in safe condition (front seat only, no passengers permitted in the back seat).
- The seatbelts for the passenger seat must be in safe, operating order.
- Passengers must be at least 12 years of age.
- Passengers must wear a helmet that meets the requirements set forth under Safety Equipment.

### Eligible Vehicles

In addition to these eligibility requirements, competitors are required to read and understand the preparation
allowances and requirements for your vehicle classification. Some vehicle classes have additional requirements or
exceptions that may impact your eligibility. It is the driver’s responsibility to ensure that their vehicle is eligible
to compete.

- Rallycross is open to any fixed-roof, four-wheeled passenger vehicle that can pass safety inspection. This includes:
- Electric & hybrid vehicles
- Convertibles with a factory hardtop or roll cage and metal roof
- Targa-type roofs with a factory panel in place
- T-tops with factory panels in place
- Trophy trucks
- UTVs, side-by-sides, crosskarts, Formula Cross, Legend cars and tube frame vehicles
- Vehicles must have body panels on all sides.
- The Race Director has the authority to determine at their discretion that a vehicle cannot safely negotiate the course
  and may exclude it from competition.
- The following vehicles are ineligible for rallycross competition:
    - ATV
    - Motorcycles

### Competition Rules

- Drugs & Alcohol: No drugs or alcohol are to be consumed during competition. If you show signs of being under the
  influence, the race director may remove you from competition at their discretion.
- Firearms: No firearms are permitted at Northwest Rally Association events.

- Driver Meeting: A mandatory driver meeting is held at the beginning of each event or recorded and distributed prior to
  the event. Every driver must attend or watch the driver meeting, must have already completed their vehicle inspection
  and checked in before competing. Drivers who do not attend the meeting will be ineligible to race.

- Parade Lap: Each driver is entitled to drive a parade lap, a course lap driven at slow speed. Any competitor that
  rides along with another competitor during the parade lap forfeits their right to drive the parade. This includes dual
  drivers - dual drivers may either take two solo laps or one lap together as a team. The parade lap is to be driven
  under 20mph without stopping, sliding or periods of rapid acceleration/deceleration. Slides, hand-brake turns,
  stopping or spinning tires during the parade lap will result in your first competition lap being scored as a DNF.

- Start Line Procedure: You will be directed to the start line by a grid worker. At the start line, the start worker
  will give you a signal when you are cleared to start. You have 25 seconds once signaled to leave the line or your run
  will be scored as a DNF (see Penalties below).

- Finish Line & Stop Box: At many events, a stop box will be present just past the finish line (marked with cones and a
  stop sign). Drivers must come to a complete stop within the stop box. A complete stop is defined as all four wheels
  stopped and the vehicle has no forward momentum. Once the vehicle has come to a complete stop, the driver may continue
  at parade speed (10 mph) back to the grid or paddock area.

- Red Flag Procedure: All course worker stations on course are equipped with a red flag that is to be used when there is
  a need to stop all cars on course (e.g. a car has stalled on course, gone off course in an unsafe manner, etc).
  Drivers may be presented with a red flag during competition runs and need to follow these steps:
    - Come to a controlled, complete stop as quickly as possible. Do not brake hard enough to cause a skid or slide.
    - Wait for directions from a course worker. Directions may be to run the remainder of the course at parade speed (
      10mph) or take a shortcut back to start/finish at parade speed.
    - Failure to stop at two consecutive red flags (driving past two course workers waving red flags) will result in a
      DNF for that run.

- Penalties: Predefined time penalties are assessed for each of the violations below.
    - Cone Penalty (2 seconds): Incurred when driver knocks a cone over or moves it out of its base box. Base box is
      defined as the imaginary box outlining the base of the cone when set in its original position. This includes the
      cone being contacted by the vehicle or by the dirt/gravel spray off the back of the vehicle.
    - Missed Gate (10 seconds): A gate is any upright course delineating cone. A missed gate is incurred when the driver
      goes to the wrong side of a cone.
    - Did Not Finish – DNF (slowest time in class + 30 seconds): Incurred when the driver fails to complete the course
      on a competition run due to mechanical failure or other incident.
    - Driving Off-Course (slowest time in class + 30 seconds): Driving off course is defined as missing two consecutive
      gates or navigating off the course in a manner that endangers course workers, spectators or other competitors. The
      race director may determine a driver is off course at their discretion.
    - Stop Box Failure (10 seconds): Failure to come to a complete stop in the stop box.

- Scoring: Your final score is the accumulation of total time on course plus any penalties incurred (there are no
  “dropped” runs – all runs are scored). The lowest time in class wins.

- Time Out: Each competitor has one time out they may use during their session that can be used for any reason (vehicle
  repairs, allowing the car to cool, fixing a debeaded tire, etc). The time-out process is as follows:
    - Driver must notify a grid or start worker that you are taking a time out.
    - The grid/start teams will begin a 10 minute timer at the time when the driver was to be at the start line for
      their run.
    - The driver must be back to the grid area within 10 minutes of their start time and must notify a grid worker that
      they are back. If the driver is unable to return to the start line within 10 minutes, their run will be scored as
      DNF.

- Debead Procedure: If a tire debeads during a competition run, the driver will be administered a red flag for safety
  reasons (a debeaded tire creates a high rollover risk). The driver will be directed to proceed to paddock at parade
  speed to fix the tire. They will be given one rerun for that competition run as long as they make it back to the grid
  area within 10 minutes of exiting the course. Note: Each driver will only be given one debead time out. After that,
  they will be scored a DNF for any subsequent debeads.

- Competition Delay Penalty: In order to avoid excessive delays, drivers who cause two red flags or other
  competition-delay events will not be able to continue competing in that event. For example, a vehicle breaks down on
  course resulting in a red flag and the driver is given a DNF for that run. The driver is able to repair the issue and
  start their next run. During that run, the car breaks down again. At this point, the driver will discontinue racing
  for that event.

- Exception: In the occurrence of a debead, the driver is given one rerun which will not count against their
  competition-delay incident. If there is a second debead, that will count as the competition-delay incident.

- Work Assignment: Each competitor is given a work assignment on race day. Typical work assignments are course worker,
  timing assistant, cleanup, etc. Failure to complete your work assignment will result in disqualification from
  competition and scoring for that event. Additionally, the race director may choose to disqualify a competitor from
  future events at their discretion.

- Ride-alongs: If a competitor wants to ride along with another driver during a race lap (non-parade laps), they are
  allowed to do so as long as they are in their car, at the line and ready to race when it is their turn. If a driver
  misses their lap due to a poorly timed ride along, they will receive a DNF for the run they missed.

### Vehicle Classification

Rallycross events operate under the expectation that competitors place themselves in the proper class at the time of
registration. If you are unsure of the appropriate class for your vehicle based on the allowances listed below, please
contact the organizers at info@nwrallyassociation.com. You may be told to move classes if your modifications are found
to qualify you into another class. For more
info: https://www.nwrallyassociation.com/rallycross-rules/#vehicle-classification

### Cancellation Policy

Before 11:59PM, 7/12/2024: Cancellations permitted at no charge.
On or after 12:00AM, 7/13/2024: No cancellations, refunds or changes to registration permitted.

### Waitlist Policy

You may be placed on the waitlist when you register for a class or race day. Due to MotorsportReg limitations, being
waitlisted for any part of the event will make you look like you are on the waitlist for the entire event. We will do
our best to keep everyone updated of their registration status via Facebook, our website and email.

If a spot opens up due to a cancellation, we will email the next person in line based on registration date and time. You
will have 24 hours to accept the spot before it is given to the next person in line. Be sure you have
katie@nwrallyassociation.com added to your address book so emails do not go to your spam folder!

If you have questions about the waitlist at any time, please don't hesitate to send us a message. Since MSReg isn't
super transparent with waitlists, we would rather you ask than be left in the dark!

### Lodging

DirtFish does not allow camping or staying overnight on their property. There are hotels in Issaquah and Snoqualmie
Pass. Vacation rentals can also be found in the surrounding areas. Given the popularity of this area in the summer,
vacancies are limited and costs can be high so we recommend sharing accommodations with friends, if you haven’t already
made arrangements.

### Pre-Race Vehicle Drop Off

You may drop your vehicle at DirtFish on Friday anytime between 3 – 5:30pm. You will be able to set up your
paddock and go through tech inspection at that time.
If you want to drop it off on Friday before 3pm, you will have to leave it in the upper overflow lot at DirtFish. Please
do NOT park in the front of the school. Instead, turn right when you reach the upper parking lot and be sure your
vehicle is off to the side.

### Spectator

Spectators are welcome and encouraged to join us on Saturday-Sunday, July 27-28th for the race weekend! There is no
charge to enter – simply sign a waiver then come hang out. Please follow any instructions or requests from staff,
volunteers and other workers – their job is to keep you safe! DirtFish will have helmets to rent for the weekend at
their booth (located near the food trucks), for spectators to ride along with competitors.

Note: No guests or spectators permitted during the workshops. This includes spouses, kids and co-drivers. Only
registered drivers may attend the workshops.

Questions? Please don’t hesitate to email us: info@nwrallyassociation.com. During the race weekend, we will be slow to
respond.

Spectators can ride along with drivers during the parade lap and competition as long as you are older than 12 years of
age. Passengers must wear a helmet that meets the requirements in our rules. We have a few helmets to loan out, but you
are much better off bringing your own if you have one.

If you want to find a driver willing to take a passenger, just ask! You can ask the drivers or ask someone on the
NWRA staff to help you out. Some drivers love having passengers, and some don’t so just find out. No one will mind you
asking!

### Workshops

#### Novice Workshop – Friday, July 26th

This year, we are changing up the Advanced workshop to give you more time in your car. The classroom portion will be
replaced with a driver meeting where we talk about the specific skills you will be working on during the day. Then you
will break into groups and practice three different elements on course in your own car. The day will culminate in a
small rallycross course to put the skills together and practice in a race-like setting.

Lunch will be provided. We do our best to meet different dietary restrictions – if you have food allergies, please
contact us in advance to confirm what options will be available for you. When you arrive for the advanced class, you
will sign a waiver and follow instructions where to park for tech inspection. You will not have to pass tech inspection
again on Race Day and you may leave your vehicle/trailer in the paddock area overnight.

*Please note that guests are not permitted during the class and must remain offsite during the day. This
includes spouses, co-drivers, family and friends. We recommend that they enjoy a local hike, a walk on
Snoqualmie Valley Trail (which can be accessed down the road from DirtFish) or check out the Snoqualmie Falls.

You must race with your number visible and clear on both sides of your car. This is how your times will be assigned to
you. If you are sharing a car with another person, you must compete with a different number than them. Please be
prepared to change your numbers between each run. You may use magnetic numbers or use a piece of tape that is sufficient
to make it clear who is racing.

You can check your race numbers here: msreg.com/2024-rxfest If you need to make changes, please email us before race
week.

##### Course Walking

Before racing, take time to walk the course. The course is marked with cones that direct you where to go. It's important
to take time and get a feel for the course before getting behind the wheel. You will get one slow speed lap in your car
before racing (parade lap).

##### Video Driver Meeting (REQUIRED)

Our driver meeting is virtual but it’s still required! Please take the time to watch the full video prior to attending
any part of Rallycross Fest, including the workshops. It will tell you what you need to know and what to expect for the
event. You can find the video on youtube here: https://youtu.be/zIMqryAj1dc

You will compete on two different courses, one course per day.

Course 1 will be in the skid pad area to the north of the planer building. Course 2 will be on the back half of the
property.

Race/Work/Rest: Drivers will be broken into two main groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Those groups will be further broken
down by class. Each day, drivers will have a race, work and rest session. In the race session, you'll be racing. In the
work session, you will be given a work assignment for your that you are required to perform. Your rest session should be
used to eat & drink, take care of any repairs/maintenance and watch some racing!

##### Work Assignments

All competitors will be assigned a work position. We will send work assignments out before the race. Please jot it down
so that you know your work assignment on race day. Note: It is required that you perform your work assignment. Failing
to do so will make you ineligible to race at current and future NWRA events. Click here to learn about course working.

### Spectator

#### Arriving at the Venue: Waiver, Cost and Parking

When you get to the venue, you will sign a waiver and pay a gate fee, if that particular venue charges one. For example,
our venues in Lind, WA and Albany, OR charge a $10 gate fee to everyone upon entrance. Not every venue charges a gate
fee so before you head to the event, check out the event page. We will always list any relevant fees there.

Once you have handled the administrative things, you will usually be given a wristband to wear for the duration of the
event and directed to the parking area. Maximum speed is 10 mph at all of our venues. Please drive carefully to keep
everyone safe.

#### What to Expect

Every venue is different, but there are a few things you can expect at most races:

- Restrooms are available onsite (but they’re usually outhouses!)

- There are no food vendors or concessions except for events at the Lind Lions Club Arena and at Rallycross Fest.

Some venues have bleachers but you should pack chairs.

Our best advice is to pack anything you may need to enjoy the day. Some essentials we reccommend:

- Bottles of water - pack more than you think you’ll need
- Snacks
- Lunch
- For cold and rainy days, pack warm hats, gloves, extra socks and shoes
- For hot days, pack a sun hat and sunscreen
- No matter the season, wear layers. The days in the PNW start out chilly and can change drastically over time.
- Regardless of the forecast, pack a rain coat and umbrella. You will need it more often than your weather app says.

#### Other Helpful Tips

- If you are wondering when to show up, check out the event schedule and look for the race sessions or run group time
  slots. Those are the hours where racing will be happening.
- Rallycross schedules are tentative! We always start at the scheduled time then the event may run a little ahead or
  behind schedule. Usually +/- 30 minutes. So keep that in mind when you’re planning your day and be flexible.
- Don’t be shy about talking to the drivers! If you want to ask a question about their car or how they got started
  racing, go for it. This is a supportive group and we are always happy to answer questions. Just be respectful if they
  need to focus on getting ready or working on their car.

#### Safety Rules, Requirements and Spectator Conduct

- Follow any posted signs and stay within designated areas when at a race. As a spectator, you are not permitted to be
  within 50 feet of the track.
- The most important thing to remember is that you are representing the sport and NWRA when you come to an event. Please
  be respectful of all people so that we can continue to do what we love.
- Rallycross events are family friendly - no drinking, drug use or rowdy behavior.
- Be respectful and supportive of your fellow spectators and competitors. This is our ‘don’t be a jerk’ rule. We have a
  zero tolerance rule for disrespect, hate, bullying, discrimination, etc.
- Dogs and cats are welcome. They must be on leashes at all times and you must pick up after them. Note: Some pets do
  not tolerate being around loud cars or crowds well. Weather can also create more extreme circumstances for your pet
  whether they are outside with you or left in the car. Please keep in mind your pet’s needs before bringing them along.
- Obey the speed limit on your way to and from NWRA events. The local authorities always know when we have races!
- Support local businesses! NWRA events are a great source of income for businesses like hotels, restaurants, coffee
  shops and stores. We love it when our community support the communities where we race as a way of saying thank you for
  having us.

### Media Policy for Photographer, Videographer, Drone pilot)

The Northwest Rally Association (NWRA) has established this media policy to establish the requirements and protocols
necessary to safely permit media personnel at motorsport events.

#### Applying for Credentials

##### General Media (Photography and Videography, no drones)

Application for general media access to NWRA events can be found on
the [Media Application page](https://www.nwrallyassociation.com/media-application) and are reviewed on a rolling basis.

least two weeks prior. Applicants will receive an email one week before each event with information, instructions, and
required paperwork. You only need to apply once per calendar year.

##### Drone Media

Application for drone media access to NWRA events can be found on
the [Drone Application page](https://www.nwrallyassociation.com/drone-application) and are reviewed on a rolling basis.
Applicants should include as much information as possible to create the best chance of approval. Submissions must be
made at least two weeks prior to an event to be considered. Applications sent less than two weeks before an event will
not be contacted until after the upcoming event. Applicants will receive an approval email as well as an email one week
before each event with information, instructions, and required paperwork. Drone operators must apply for each individual
event as we must control the drones in operation at events.

**Please note**: An FAA license is preferred but not required. If you are not a licensed pilot, we will conduct a more
thorough review of your work to ensure that you have a long history of safe conduct at motorsports events.

#### NWRA Media Use Policy

- NWRA reserves the right to receive copies of images, video, or audio content created at NWRA events by media
  personnel. Any content used in NWRA social media postings on behalf of NWRA will be credited to the creator.
- NWRA reserves the right to demand content deemed harmful to the organization, events or competitors be removed
  immediately.
- NWRA may ban any media personnel or outlet unwilling to follow NWRA media policies.
- Content created for commercial use must be pre-approved by NWRA. All media planning a commercial digital, film, or
  television program must contact NWRA at [info@nwrallyassociation.com](mailto:info@nwrallyassociation.com) with a
  detailed description and proposal of the requested commercial use. Proposals will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

#### Media Code of Conduct

By applying for NWRA media access, applicants agree to uphold the following Code of Conduct. All media personnel must:

- Be responsible for the safety of competitors, race officials/workers, and themselves.
- Follow instructions from all race officials and workers at all times.
- Treat all officials, volunteers, spectators, the public, and other competitors with respect and courtesy.
- Know, understand, and follow all regulations as stated herein.

#### On-course Safety Procedures

Racing is a dangerous activity and all who participate as competitors, workers, and attendees are responsible for their
own personal safety and the safety of others. NWRA has drafted these safety protocols to help media personnel maintain a
safe position and practices.

1. **Pay attention**. Vehicles can lose control at any point in competition.
    - Always keep your eyes on the cars and avoid turning your back on the course/track. Often, there will be 2-4 cars
      on a course at a given time.
    - Listen for cars approaching as you will often hear them before you see them. Keep in mind that electric vehicles
      put off little noise so do not rely solely on sound to alert you of an approaching vehicle.
    - Avoid unnecessary distractions such as using your phone while on course. Move to a safe location to engage in
      these activities.
2. **Do not stand on the outside of corners or likely crash zones** such as downrange from jumps or fast sections.
3. **Stand at least three feet back from barriers** such as ecology blocks, walls, or Armco/traffic barriers.
4. **Have an escape route planned** to allow you to reach a safe location in the event a vehicle loses control.
5. **Do not enter or cross the course/track during competition** and plan your locations accordingly. If you choose to
   be on the infield of the course, plan to stay for the duration of the session. There may be periods of time where
   competition is stopped or paused, during which you may cross the course/track only if you have received the approval
   of an official or worker.
6. **Follow the directions of NWRA officials and workers at all times**.
7. **Any media person wishing to work outside of the spectator area must have prior approval from NWRA**.
8. **All media personnel must wear a yellow, high-visibility vest**. NWRA can issue the vest or you may provide your
   own. No other colors are permitted.

#### Drone Policy

NWRA may grant media access to drone operators under limited conditions. To apply for credentials, apply using
the [Drone Media Application form](https://www.nwrallyassociation.com/drone-application). Applicants will be reviewed
based on:

- Experience operating a drone in a motorsport setting
- Volume and duration of experience
- Certifications

Applicants will be notified no less than one week prior to an event of their eligibility. If an application for drone
operation is denied, you are still eligible for standard media access. Drone applications must be submitted two weeks
ahead of an event to be reviewed in time for said event.

#### Package Booking Reminder

Because of the 2-course and race/work/rest layout, there will be class running on both course during the same session.
This will make it hard to cover clients if clients end up on both course at the same time.

Here's a summary of simultaneous run groups by time

- Saturday
    - Session 1: Group 1A (Stock FWD and Mod FWD) and group 2A (Prepared RWD and MA-TS)
    - Session 2: Group 1B (Stock RWD and Prepared AWD) and group 2B (Prepared FWD and MA-NA)
    - Session 3: Group 1C (Stock AWD and Open 4) and group 2C (Mod RWD)
- Sunday
    - Session 1: Group 1B (Stock RWD and Prepared AWD) and group 2B (Prepared FWD and MA-NA)
